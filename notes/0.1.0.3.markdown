to support the development of OML processing workflows.

### Bug Fixes

- [#3 Missing Dependency in Binary Build](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.converters/issues/3)

  Filtered out including the `log4j.zip` whose contents, a source/doc `log4j.jar` library, overwrote the implementation.
   
### Work In Progress

- [#1 Refactor the conversion logic for parity across oml, owl & tablular representations](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.converters/issues/1)

  OWL (TBox) => OML (TBox tables) except for annotation properties & annotations.
